# roadmap-single-page-cv
Just playing with a roadmap project to show how to use HTML.

This is a simple HTML page to demostrating how to structure a resume.

This is a personal challenge to complete frontend roadmap projects.

The project roadmap can be found here: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
